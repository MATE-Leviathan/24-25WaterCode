This program models the path of carp. It creates a GIF from the csv file.

To correctly run this program, first enter the data into the CarpData csv file, 
then download both the CarpData.csv and Location-of-the-Illinois-River-basin resized base.png
replace the "base_map" variable with the path to the downloaded png
replace df with the download csv file
Finally when you run the Illinois_river_animation.gif should update to represent the data in the csv file
